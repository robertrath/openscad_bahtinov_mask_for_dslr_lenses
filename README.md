# openscad_bahtinov_mask_for_dslr_lenses

Thiniverse Project: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2823413

Summary

This modification extends Eric Lofgren's modifications to Brent Burton's original Bahtinov mask generator specifically targeting a collection of DSLR lenses rather than a single lens.

A table of lenses and their attributes is the source for mask creation. Simply uncomment the lens you wish to create a mask for or add new lenses to the table as per the layout in the SCAD file.

Pre-configured Lenses:

* Sigma Art 50mm f/1.4
* Canon 100mm Macro f/2.8L
* Canon 7-200 f/2.8L II
* Sigma Sport 150-600mm f/5-6.3
* Optex 6 Inch Telescope External Attachment
* Optex 6 Inch Telescope Internal Attachment
* Tamron 18-400mm (courtesy of Lucas Di Pentima, https://www.thingiverse.com/ldipenti/about)
